					3. SIMPSON’S th RULE

				 Introduction :-
					Another method of numerical integration method
				called “Simpson’s 3/8 rule”. It is completely based on
				the cubic interpolation rather than the quadratic
				interpolation. This rule quite more accurate than the
				standard method, as it uses one more functional
				value. For 3/8 rule, the composite Simpson’s 3/8 rule
				also exists which is similar to the generalized form.
				The 3/8 rule is known as Simpson’s second rule of
				integration.


				 General formula :-

				f(x)=[(y0+yn)+3(y1+y2+y4+…)+2(y3+y6+…)]
