						1. TRAPEZOIDAL RULE

				 Introduction :-

					In mathematics, the trapezoid rule is a numerical integration
				method, that is, a method to calculate approximately the
				value of the definite integral.
				The rule is based on approximating the value of the integral
				of f (x) by that of the linear function that passes through the
				points (a, f (a)) and (b, f (b)). The integral of this is equal to
				the area of the trapezoid under the graph of the linear
				function.

				 Application :-

					The integrals have many applications in real life,
				from measuring the volume of a container, and
				different applications in speed. Another use of
				integrals is for economic studies.

				 General formula of trapezoidal method :-
				f(x)=[(y0+yn)+2(y1+y2+y3+y4+â€¦+yn-1)]
