					2. SIMPSON’S rd RULE

				 Introduction :-
					Simpson’s rule is one of the numerical methods
				which is used to evaluate the definite integral.
				Usually, to find the definite integral, we use the
				fundamental theorem of calculus, where we haveto
				apply the antiderivative techniques of integration. But
				sometimes it is difficult to find theantiderivative of
				an integral, like in the case of Scientific Experiments,
				where the function hasto be determined from the
				observed readings. Therefore, the numerical methods
				are used to approximatethe integral in such
				conditions. Other numerical methods used are
				trapezoidal rule, midpoint rule, Here, we are going to
				discuss Simpson’s rule formula, 1/3 rd rule.

				 Application :-
					It is used when it is very difficult to solve the given
				integral mathematically.This rule gives approximation easily without actually
				knowing the integration rules.

				 General formula :-

				f(x)=[(y0+yn)+4(y2+y4+...)+2(y1+y3+…)]
